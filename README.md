 A Builder and Stub example in GoLANG. The builder adds a Delimiter to the end of the file and then adds the name you entered. If used this should at the vary least be encoded as strings are in plain text.
 
 
# How to use
	- Build the Builder.go and the Stub.go
	- Put both in the same Directory and run Builder
	- Type your name and press enter or return
	- The built file will be saved as 'BuiltStub.exe'
